# Hurricane Data Analysis Project

This project involves the analysis of data on the 34 strongest Atlantic hurricanes. It was completed as part of a Codecademy project, and the goal is to develop Python code to analyze and categorize these hurricanes based on various metrics such as the areas they affected, their wind speeds, the damages they caused, and the mortality rates associated with them.

## Project Description

The project consists of a series of functions that perform the following tasks:

1. **Convert damages**: Convert damage data from strings with 'M' (millions) or 'B' (billions) to numerical values.
2. **Create a hurricane dictionary**: Organize hurricane data into a dictionary where each hurricane is the key, and its details (such as year, areas affected, damages, etc.) are stored as values.
3. **Organize hurricanes by year**: Create a dictionary that groups hurricanes by the year they occurred.
4. **Count affected areas**: Count how often each area in the Atlantic was affected by a hurricane.
5. **Find the most affected area**: Identify the area most frequently hit by hurricanes.
6. **Find the most deadly hurricane**: Find which hurricane caused the most deaths.
7. **Rate hurricanes by mortality**: Categorize hurricanes into ratings based on how many deaths they caused.
8. **Find the most costly hurricane**: Find the hurricane that caused the greatest economic damage.
9. **Rate hurricanes by damage**: Categorize hurricanes into ratings based on how much economic damage they caused.

## How to Run the Project

To run this project, clone the repository and execute the `script.py` file. The script will:

- Convert and clean the hurricane data.
- Perform various analyses on the data, such as organizing hurricanes by the year, counting how many times each area was affected, and finding the most damaging or deadly hurricanes.
- Categorize hurricanes based on mortality and damage ratings.

## Acknowledgments

This project was completed as part of Codecademy's Python course, where we learned various data analysis techniques using Python. The hurricane dataset and the guidance on analysis were provided as part of this learning experience.
